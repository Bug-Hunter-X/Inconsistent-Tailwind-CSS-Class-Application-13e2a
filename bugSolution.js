```javascript
// Ensure that your Tailwind configuration is correctly set up and that the styles are being properly imported.
//Check for conflicting CSS rules that might override your Tailwind classes.
//Ensure the correct build process and asset pipeline are used.
//Consider using the purge option or the `@layer` directive in your `tailwind.config.js` for better optimization.

//Example implementation using @layer:
//@layer components {
  .my-custom-class {
    @apply bg-red-500 p-4; 
  }
}

//Then, use the custom class in your HTML:
<div class="my-custom-class">
  <p>This text should be red and have padding.</p>
</div>
```
